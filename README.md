# 📚 Week 8 – Python Data Structures & My First Backend Project 🚀
 
Welcome to my Week 8 journey at App Academy!  
This project is all about mastering Python’s core data structures and using them to build my very first backend application from scratch.

---

## 🏆 Project Purpose

**This project is a hands-on exploration of Python’s most important data structures — lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets — and how they power real backend solutions.**  
I’m not just learning syntax; I’m applying these concepts to design, build, and test a functional backend system using only Python.

## 🔙 Looking Back: Week 7

Last week, I took my first steps into Python and backend development. It was challenging, but I pushed through and built a foundation for what’s next.

---

## 🔎 This Week’s Focus

- Deep dive into Python’s data structures
- Learn how to use them to solve real-world problems
- Build a complete backend project from the ground up

---

## 🧠 What I’ll Learn

- 📦 **Lists**: Storing and managing collections of data
- 📕 **Dictionaries**: Fast lookups and key-value storage
- 🧱 **Tuples**: Immutable sequences for fixed data
- 🧮 **Sets**: Unique collections and set operations

Understanding these will help me write cleaner, more efficient, and more powerful code.

---

## 🏗️ What I’ll Build

- Design my own backend architecture
- Write all the code myself
- Test and debug every part
- Create a working backend solution using only Python

This is my first real backend project — a big step in my developer journey!

---

## ✅ Goals for the Week

- Gain confidence with Python’s data structures
- Complete my first full backend project
- Strengthen my problem-solving and backend logic skills

---

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

This project is more than just code — it’s about building real skills and proving to myself that I can tackle backend development with Python.  
I’m excited for the challenge and ready to grow as a developer.

Let’s get building! 🚀
